# Scraper Notes

# romsmania.cc

This one is basically a treasure trove if I can manage to figure out how 
it works and reliably scraper the rom download links out of it.

Normal URL:
`https://romsmania.cc/`


Searched 'turtles in time':
`https://romsmania.cc/search?name=turtles+in+time`

`search?name=turtles+in+time`

`search?name=<word>[+]<word>`

<word> = <"searchtext">
+ = [" "] = each space is represented by a + or at least the gap between 
each word, whether made of up one or more spaces.
